# This file is a placeholder for the YOLOv8 model
# The actual model file will be downloaded automatically by ultralytics
# when the MalpracticeDetector class is initialized

# Model download is handled in detection.py:
# self.yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # Will download if not present

# For manual download, you can use:
# wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt
